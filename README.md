# Qencode Authentication UI

This project is an implementation of the Qencode Authentication UI, designed with React and integrated with a mock authentication API. It showcases login, password reset, and setting a new password functionalities. The UI is built using Vite as the build tool, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn (`sonner`) for toast notifications.

## Features

- Responsive Login Form
- Password Reset Flow
- New Password Setting Form
- Live form validation
- Toast notifications for feedback

```

2. Install the dependencies:
